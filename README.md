SymPy tutorial for SciPy 2014
=============================

This is the tutorial that Aaron Meurer, Matthew Rocklin, and Jason Moore are
giving at SciPy 2014 for SymPy.  If you are attending the tutorial, please
install Anaconda. You will need SymPy 0.7.5 and IPython 2.1.0.  The exercises
for attendees are in the tutorial_exercises directory. Everything else is
presentation materials for us.

If you want to build the tutorial presentation, use `make html` in the
tutorial_sphinx directory. It is basically the same as the SymPy tutorial at
http://docs.sympy.org/tutorial/tutorial/.


**NOTE: This tutorial is out of date with the latest version of SymPy. I
  recommend reading the
  [official tutorial](http://docs.sympy.org/latest/tutorial/index.html), which
  is based on this. The exercise notebooks in this repo should still prove to
  be useful companions to the official tutorial, however.**
