SymPy tutorial for SciPy 2016
=============================

This is the tutorial that Ondřej Čertík, Aaron Meurer, Amit Kumar, Jason Moore, Sartaj Singh, Harsh Gupta are
giving at SciPy 2016 for SymPy.  If you are attending the tutorial, please
install Anaconda. You will need SymPy 1.0 and IPython 4.1.2.  The exercises
for attendees are in the tutorial_exercises directory. Everything else is
presentation materials for us.

If you want to build the tutorial presentation, use `make html` in the
tutorial_sphinx directory. It is basically the same as the SymPy tutorial at
http://docs.sympy.org/tutorial/tutorial/.
